sentence=The FlashStorage_STM32 library aims to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve user's data using the non-volatile flash memory of STM32F/L/H/G/WB/MP1. It's using the buffered read and write to minimize the access to Flash. It now supports writing and reading the whole object, not just byte-and-byte. New STM32 core v2.0.0 is also supported now.
paragraph=Useful if the EEPROM is not available or too small. Currently, STM32F/L/H/G/WB/MP1 are supported.
